  <h1>Graph Coloring with Deep Learning</h1>
</div>

<p>A deep learning-based hybrid approach for the graph coloring problem, with a focus on register allocation in compilers. This repository provides an implementation of the algorithm described in the research paper "Deep Learning-based Hybrid Graph-Coloring Algorithm for Register Allocation" by Dibyendu Das, Shahid Asghar Ahmad, and Kumar Venkataramanan.</p>

<div class="description">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This project aims to learn a good heuristic for coloring interference graphs used in the register allocation phase of compilers. The algorithm combines a deep learning model and a color correction phase to achieve efficient graph coloring.</p>
  <p>The deep learning model is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. It takes the adjacency matrix of a graph as input and outputs the colors assigned to each node. The color correction phase resolves any invalid colorings by reassigning colors to adjacent nodes with the same color.</p>
  <p>The implementation is designed to handle moderate-sized interference graphs with up to 100 nodes. It performs favorably compared to optimal coloring on popular graphs and LLVM's greedy register allocator for SPEC CPUÂ® 2017 benchmarks.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Install the required dependencies:
      <pre><code>pip install tensorflow numpy</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Run the example code:
      <pre><code class="python"># Generate or load some graphs
graphs = [
    Graph([[0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]]),
    Graph([[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0]]),
    # ... more graphs
]

# Train the model
model = train(graphs)

# Infer colors for a new graph
new_graph = Graph([[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]])
colors = infer(model, new_graph)

# Apply color correction
corrected_colors = color_correction(new_graph, colors)
print("Corrected colors:", corrected_colors)</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
