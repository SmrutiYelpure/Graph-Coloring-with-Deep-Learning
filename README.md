# Graph-Coloring-with-Deep-Learning
A hybrid deep learning-based approach for graph coloring, focused on register allocation in compilers. An implementation of the algorithm described in the research paper "Deep Learning-based Hybrid Graph-Coloring Algorithm for Register Allocation" by Das, Asghar Ahmad, et al. on graph coloring for register allocation.
